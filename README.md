# How it works 

This is a simple example of how pokedex looks like. There is a search bar and button where pokemon can be searched using pokemon's name and it's id. The search result will show the pokemon name and its image. TO see details of the pokemon, click on the pokemon card.  I will show the pokemon's name, image, abilities, and types. 

On the first page it show limited list of pokemon card with their name and image. To see more pokemon, click on the pokemon card to see more details of the pokemon.
